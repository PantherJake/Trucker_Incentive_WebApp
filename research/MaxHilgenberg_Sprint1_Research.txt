Research file for Sprint 1

first I needed to learn how to work with the DevOps repo, so I went through Microsofts tutorial:
- before cloning the repo I needed to create a user, so that I can actually push stuff onto that repository
- now it is cloned on my laptop and hence I pushed this file and others onto the repo from my testing

Vue Practice: 
I created a public Github repository to learning how vue.js works. Each commit is a part from the same tutorial on learning how Vue.js works:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpIoQ_rT_c
My repo: https://github.com/mhilgen/VuePractice

I also practiced some basic javascript, css tab practice: 
    I deployed that on github: https://mhilgen.github.io/WebTabPractice/

Turns out that the only package you need to connect your database with python is pymysql, which is a lot simpler than Java. 

I also needed to find some tutorials for lambda functions, which are uploaded in the /back-end/testing/Lamba directory
- the addUser lamba function basically adds a user to my testing database on aws. That function also connects to the database obviously
