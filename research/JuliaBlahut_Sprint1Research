Sprint 1:

JavaScript:
So far I have learned JavaScript basics. I completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures:
Basic JavaScript tutorial challenges found at freecodecamp.org.

Vue.js:
I've found some possible packages we could use such as Vuetify to make designing the application
better/easier. I've also found a package called Vue Meta that can be used to improve search engine
performance. I also cloned the repo onto my local computer and figured out how to access the vue.js
files. Finally, I went through the Vue.js tutorial on their website.

Python:
I've reviewed the basics of Python by completing some of the Python tutorials on freecodecamp.org and
since I've previously used Python in my CPSC 3600 Networking class I was able to review those assignments
and remember how I coded them.
